# Adept Friends Finder

This week, I'm spoofing a well known social media site.

The goal is to create a (mostly) full stack application that leverages node.js and an express web server to maintain an in-memory database of people and their responses to a Meyers-Briggs personality assessment.  Users respond to the questions to determine their closest match based upon an MBTI compatibility metric.

## MBTI assessment survey:

This is probably the weakest link.  I snagged some questions from John Hawksley's simplified assessment website (http://jupiter-34.appspot.com/) and added my own 
rudimentary weightings to the responses.  A true Meyers-Briggs assessment involves many more questions and a trained assessment professional.
